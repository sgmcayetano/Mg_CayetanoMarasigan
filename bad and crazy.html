        Bad and Crazy revolves around the story of a police officer named Ryu Su-yeol, the Superintendent of the Anti-Corruption Team. The 12-episode show is divided into three arcs with four episodes each. <br/><br/>

        There are four main characters in the show. Ryu Su-Yeol, the main character, is introduced as a corrupt police officer, despite being part of the Anti-Corruption Team. He accepts bribes and gets on his superiors' good side so that he could get what he wants. Lee Hui-Gyeom is an officer of the Narcotics Department and the love interest of the main character. Oh Gyeong-Tae is a promising young police officer who has highly-defined morals that were never broken. There is also a mysterious man named K who keeps causing chaos. It is revealed later in the first arc that K is actually Ryu Su-Yeol's alter, and Su-Yeol is diagnosed with having DID, or Dissociative Identity Disorder. <br/><br/>
        
        The first arc revolves around the investigation of an Assemblyman Do Yu-Gon who was running for President of Korea, but it also serves as an introduction to the main characters of the story. The main antagonist of this arc is Assemblyman Do Yu-Gon, a corrupt assemblyman who is wanted for killing Jung Yoon-A for revealing Do's crimes such as illegal drug possession and many others. In this arc, we see the relationship between Ryu Su-Yeol and K, which starts off as bitter as K has no concept of self-control, and Ryu Su-Yeol does not know how to control his alter. This arc also shows that Su-Yeol, despite being a corrupt police officer, cares for Korea and that he wants to, as much as possible, make sure that all criminals get the punishment that they deserve. It also gives emphasis on the type of candidate that makes the masses think that they're good and helpful on the surface, but corrupt and selfish deep down. <br/><br/>
        
        The next arc revolves around the Narcotics Unit and the murder of one of their team members, Sim Sang-Ho. This further discusses the corruption of the police - how people would go through whatever lengths they need to in order to become richer, how people would get their hands dirty just for their own sake, and how those who aren't eaten up by the shadows of greed are instead eaten up by the corrupt and always made as the prime target. In this arc, we also see the relationship between Su-Yeol and K develop into a more understanding and mutual relationship, as they help each other with their endeavors and understand each others' motives. They learn to get used to each other after some time, and eventually, they even get to love each other. <br/><br/>
        
        The last arc delves deeper into Ryu Su-Yeol's and K's backstory, and how K emerged. It gives emphasis on how traumatic events should not be taken lightly, and it also educates its audience on mental illnesses caused by trauma such as PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and DID. It is mentioned in the second arc that DID emerges as the brain's coping mechanism after experiencing a traumatizing event, and that each alter is almost like a completely different person. This alter takes the host's traumatic memories so that the host would no longer remember their trauma, and the alter carries the trauma and the baggage with them for the benefit of the host. This traumatic event that caused K to emerge is explored in this last arc while a series of murders that seem unrelated is being investigated. Behind these murders is a mastermind who is disguised as a therapist, one of his patients being Su-Yeol. In this arc, Ryu Su-Yeol comes to terms with his trauma, and because of this, K disappears because he is no longer needed. The show ends with a bittersweet ending of Ryu Su-Yeol rejoicing because he has finally come to terms with his trauma and at the same time mourning the loss of his alter, who was also his best friend.

      <p> I enjoyed this show because of how it highlights the fact that people in power could almost always escape from their crimes. Do Yu-Gon, the antagonist of the first arc, was a drug addict, and he even killed someone for exposing that fact. However, he almost got away with it, and he was even the most promising candidate for president of Korea. Kim Gye-Shik, the leader of the Narcotics Department and the antagonist of the second arc, got away with selling illegal drugs (which is very hypocritial given that he was the leader of the Narcotics Department!) and killing his partner for telling him to stop doing so. <br/><br/>
        
          I also enjoyed this show because of how accurate their depiction of trauma and mental health issues is. Mental health issues are something that some people are still close-minded about, because some people still think that having mental health issues means that someone is "weak" because they're unable to handle their emotions. However, that is not the case. People just have different approaches on how they view the world and their problems, and each person also has different experiences and opinions on these experiences. For instance, Ryu Su-yeol created an alter to protect himself from the trauma of his childhood, while Jung Yun-Ho, the main antagonist of the third arc, embraced this trauma and pushed it onto others by disguising as a therapist to manipulate his patients to kill for each other. Each and every police officer in the series also experienced some kind of trauma due to the nature of their work, and they mentioned in the series that it's okay to take breaks for this to recover from everything that is going on. Mental health issues have different types of manifestations, but it is highlighted in the series that feeling these feelings are valid, and you can recover from them with the help of the people around you. <p>
