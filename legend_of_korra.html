        <h1> The Legend of Korra (2012) </h1>
        <p>TLOK is the successor of the critically-acclaimed series Avatar: The Last Airbender. It centers around the main protagonist, Korra, who is struggling to live up to the legacy of the previous avatar, Aang. She wrestles with her desperation for a purpose, especially as different antagonists convince her she doesn't have one. The series has four seasons, each dedicated to their separate villains, all with their own special parallels to Korra.
  Season One features Amon, the leader of the radical anti-bender group of 'Equalists'. While non-benders have made several attempts in the past to revolt against the harsh and unfair system promoting bender-superiority, they have all failed. The quality that sets Amon apart is his excellence at persuading/manipulating people. He is mystifying, charismatic, and most importantly, qualified. He has somehow managed to find a way to expel benders of their abilities, and this earns him the city's favor and trust. However, while this miracle may seem like a good thing for the Equalist movement, it eventually reveals itself to be something much more sinister, adding complexity to his character.
  Season Two introduces Unalaq, the chief of the Northern and Southern Water tribes, also known as Korra's uncle. He is presented as an effective leader, pushing both of the Water tribes to their utmost prosperity. Korra also grew to view him as a mentor, especially when he showed her his spiritbending abilitiesâ€” an unheard of and newly created waterbending art. Despite all this, he is later found out to be a self-righteous liar, remorseless abuser, and medium for a dark spirit opposing the Avatar. His actions go on to change the people's way of life and their view of the Avatar drastically, and ghosts from his past whom he betrayed decide to haunt and use Korra as the next step of their plan.
  The third season has what most audiences agree to be the best villain: Zaheer, who is the leader of the Red Lotus, an anarchist faction broken off the Order of the White Lotus. (elaborate on how he got his airbending, plan to use korra, execution of that plan, air temple infiltration, and lasting effects of the ptsd he caused korra).
  The last antagonist is Kuvira, (mention parallelism of belief system to fascism. elaborate on past life in zaofu, military contributions for the earth kingdom, establishment of the earth empire, invention of spirit-weapon, republic city conquering and use of mechas, and how she was the only antagonist korra ever had a chance of saving). </p>
